# Rally-compose-sample
The design of this app was heavily inspired by Rally, a Material Design study. The starting point of this project was taken from the Official Jetpack Compose samples repo.

ðŸš§ This app is currently a work in progress.

Rally is a personal finance app that helps you keep track of your savings and transactions and summarizes the data in relevent charts. Note that this app requires manual input and is not connected to any of your bank accounts - this choice is intentional.

At the moment this app is mainly developed for a swedish audience however in the future it will be fully translated to english.
